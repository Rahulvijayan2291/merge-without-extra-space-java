## üìú Problem Statement

You are given two sorted arrays `a[]` and `b[]` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively. Your task is to:
1. Merge the two arrays so that the **first `n` elements** reside in `a[]`.
2. The **last `m` elements** reside in `b[]`.
3. Do this **without using extra space for merging**.

### Example

**Input**:  
`a[] = {1, 4, 7, 8, 10}`  
`b[] = {2, 3, 9}`  

**Output**:  
`a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}`  
`b[] = {8, 9, 10}`

## üîç Solution Overview

The solution focuses on merging the two arrays efficiently using Java‚Äôs inbuilt methods:  
1. **Combine the arrays**: Use `System.arraycopy` to merge the two arrays into a single temporary array.  
2. **Sort the combined array**: Use `Arrays.sort()` to sort all the elements in ascending order.  
3. **Split the sorted array**: Copy the first `n` elements back to `a[]` and the remaining `m` elements back to `b[]`.

This method keeps the solution concise and leverages Java's powerful inbuilt utilities for optimal performance.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Merging arrays: `O(n + m)`  
  - Sorting the array: `O((n + m) log(n + m))`  
  - Copying back: `O(n + m)`  
  - **Overall**: **O((n + m) log(n + m))**

- **Space Complexity**:  
  - Temporary array of size `n + m`: **O(n + m)**
